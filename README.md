# Video Streaming Service App
Develop a web application that allows users to browse, search, and watch video content. This project will demonstrate your skills in handling video content, user data, recommendations algorithms, and possibly even basic machine learning for personalized suggestions. Focus on creating a responsive design to cater to various devices and screen sizes.

Key Features:
User registration, authentication, and profile management.
Video streaming capabilities with adaptive bitrate streaming to adjust video quality based on the user's internet speed (using HLS or MPEG-DASH).
A content discovery system that includes search functionality, categories/tags, and a recommendation engine based on user preferences and viewing history.
User interfaces for different device types (responsive design or dedicated mobile app development using something like React Native).
Ratings and reviews for videos.
Watch history and watchlist features.


Technology Stack Suggestions:
Frontend: Use React.js for building a dynamic and responsive user interface. Consider frameworks like Next.js for React to improve SEO and performance. For mobile, React Native can be a good choice to cover both iOS and Android with a single codebase.
Backend: Node.js with Express.js is a popular choice for handling backend logic, including user authentication, database interactions, and serving video content. Flask or Django can be alternatives if you prefer Python.
Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL can store user data, video metadata, and user interactions (like watch history and ratings). Elasticsearch can be added for advanced search capabilities.
Video Processing: Use FFmpeg for video transcoding to ensure your videos are in a web-friendly format. Consider implementing HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) or MPEG-DASH for adaptive bitrate streaming to dynamically adjust video quality.
Hosting/Cloud: AWS or Google Cloud offers a range of services for hosting your application, storing videos (using services like S3 or Google Cloud Storage), and even machine learning capabilities for recommendation algorithms (AWS SageMaker or Google AI Platform).
